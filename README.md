## Something about the project

The project consists in simulating the movements of a tractor equipped with artificial intelligence inside a field. 
The tractor can move only within the field. 
The tractor builds decision trees in order to smooth the ground along the best route. 
The tractor can take sand (the amount expressed in the matrix) and move it to the adjacent plates.

The program does not have a graphical interface.
